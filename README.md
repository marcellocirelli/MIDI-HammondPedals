# MIDI-HammondPedals
Full 12 key MIDI controller using Hammond M3 Pedals with sustain pedal, expression pedal, and 3 momentary stomps

I made this after finishing a Hammond chop. It allows me to play notes, trigger effects/samples, do program changes, volume control, sustain and more.
Included is a CAD drawing of the enclosure currently in development for on-stage use.
